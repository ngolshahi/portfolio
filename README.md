# Portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase some of the projects I've worked on during my time as a Computer Science student. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - keeping things simple and fast.

## What's here

- **Home**: Quick intro with a typewriter effect (because why not make it a bit more interesting)
- **About Me**: A bit about my background and interests
- **Portfolio**: Collection of projects I'm proud of, from my final year project to various coursework
- **Contact**: How to reach me

## Projects featured

Some highlights include:
- My final year project ([Hearing Aid Platform](https://github.com/ngolshahi/hearing-aid-platform) with AR/VR features)
- Research on causal reasoning in LLMs
- Various cloud computing and database projects
- Computer vision work
- And a bunch of other stuff I've tinkered with

## Tech stuff

The site uses:
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks, just keeping it simple)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Responsive design that works on mobile
- Some CSS animations for a bit of visual flair

## Getting started

If you want to run this locally (though I'm not sure why you would):

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about any of the projects or just want to connect!
